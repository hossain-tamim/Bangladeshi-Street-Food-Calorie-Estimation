# Bangladeshi-Street-Food-Calorie-Estimation

As obesity rates continue to increase, automated
calorie tracking has become a vital tool for people seeking to
maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a diet plan. Although
numerous research efforts have addressed this issue, existing
approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only
constant caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition
challenges, challenges in image scaling and normalization, and
a predominant focus on Western cuisines. In this paper, we
propose a tailored solution that specifically targets Bangladeshi
street food. We first construct a diverse dataset of popular street
foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a refined calorie
estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision model
YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification
and segmentation results, with only a slight increase in com-
putational complexity compared to the base variant. Coupled
with a machine learning regression model, our system achieves
an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% RÂ² score in calorie
estimation, making it both highly effective and accurate for real-
world food calorie calculations.
