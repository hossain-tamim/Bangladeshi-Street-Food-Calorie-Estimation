# Bangladeshi-Street-Food-Calorie-Estimation

With the rise of obesity calorie tracking has become an important task for anyone wanting to lead a
healthy lifestyle or looking to follow through with a dietary regiment. However, manual tracking is
often inconvenient, time-consuming, and prone to human error, highlighting the need for automated
solutions. In this paper we propose an innovative approach for tackling this problem specifically targeting
Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse dataset composed of popular street foods
found in Bangladesh. Then we implement an effective calorie estimation system focused specifically
on Bangladeshi street food by improving upon the state of the art vision model YoloV8. Our modified
model achieves better results in terms of classification and segmentation with a slight trade-off
in computational complexity when compared to base variant. Pairing this with a machine learning
regression model we achieve an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root mean squared
error (RMSE) and 96.0% RÂ² Score in calorie estimation making our system highly effective and
accurate in calculating real word food calories.
